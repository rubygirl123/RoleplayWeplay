You’re releived.
Any sickness is very serious in the first two months of a baby’s life. 
The nurse/doctors were able to help you to rid your child’s illness.
You’re hospital stay may have been longer than you expected, but it was worth it.
Now you are ready to leave with your new baby. You’re relatives have to picked you up. 
Although a car seat is ready, you would prefer to hold your baby on his/her first ride home.
