             <p>Q3)The next thing you know, there are sirens. 
                 Police and ambulances. The car accident wasn’t that serious. 
                 Everyone had minor injuries - except the baby.The baby wasn’t hurt at all. 
                 The car seat was able to protect the baby. Now that you’re home, you just want to lay your head down and sleep. 
                 One problem your baby won’t shut up. You try everything: 
                 feeding, changing diaper,singing, yelling. 
                 You are so frustrated that you end up shaking the child - just a little bit. 
                 It quiets for a little bit, but then the crying starts up again. 
                 It’s three o’clock in the morning and you desperately want to sleep.
