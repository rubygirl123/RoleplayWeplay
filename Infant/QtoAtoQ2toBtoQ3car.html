             <p>Q3)The next thing you know, there are sirens. 
                 Police and ambulances. The car accident wasn ' t that serious. 
                 Everyone had minor injuries - except the baby.The baby wasn ' t hurt at all. 
                 The car seat was able to protect the baby. Now that you ' re home, you just want to lay your head down and sleep. 
                 One problem your baby won ' t shut up. You try everything: 
                 feeding, changing diaper,singing, yelling. 
                 You are so frustrated that you end up shaking the child - just a little bit. 
                 It quiets for a little bit, but then the crying starts up again. 
                 It is <p style="color:red"> three o ' clock</p> in the morning and you desperately want to sleep.
