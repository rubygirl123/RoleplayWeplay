             <p>The next thing you know, there are sirens. 
                 Police and ambulances.<br> 
                 The car accident was not that serious.<br> 
                 Everyone had minor injuries - except the baby.<br> 
                 The baby girl/boy is dead. 
                 Not only do you have to deal with the grief of losing a child, you are under             investigation<br> and this thought is forever in your brain:<br> 
                 had you put your baby in that car seat would he/she still be alive ?
