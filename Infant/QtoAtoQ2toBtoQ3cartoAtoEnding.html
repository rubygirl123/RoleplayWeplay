              <p> Thank goodness you called for help. If you had gone any farther, you ' re baby could've died. Shaken baby syndrome is caused by shaking or jerking a baby or young child. Even a few seconds of shaking can injure a baby. Babies and young children are more vulnerable to injuries from this type of movement because the neck muscles of young children, especially babies, are not very strong. It can be tough for them to fully support their heavy heads or protect themselves from harsh movements.
Baby's brains are so fragile shaking movements can cause the brain to move back and forth inside their skulls. The movement can injure the brain and tear small blood vessels. You managed to get help from a family member or friend. It'll take some work but eventually you'll get better at taking care of your baby </p>
