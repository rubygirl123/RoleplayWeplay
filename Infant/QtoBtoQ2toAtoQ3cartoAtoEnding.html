            <p> The next thing you know, there are sirens. 
                 Police and ambulances. The car accident wasn ' t that serious. 
                 Everyone had minor injuries - except the baby. The baby girl/boy is dead. 
                 Not only do you have to deal with the grief of losing a child, you are under investigation and this thought is forever in your brain: 
       had you put your baby in that car seat would he/she still be alive ?</p>
