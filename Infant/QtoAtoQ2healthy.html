             <p>Q2)A.Good thing you washed your hands. 
                 Newborns are very susceptible to diseases. 
                 While you’re in the hospital, you always make sure that anyone who holds the baby either sanitizes or washes their hand.Now you are ready to leave with your new baby.
                 You’re relatives have to picked you up. Although a car seat is ready, you would prefer to hold your baby on his/her first ride home.
