             <p> The next thing you know, there are sirens. 
                 Police and ambulances. 
                 The car accident wasnâ€™t that serious. 
                 Everyone had minor injuries - except the baby. 
                 The baby girl/boy is dead. 
                 Not only do you have to deal with the grief of losing a child, you are under investigation and this thought is forever in your brain: 
                 had you put your baby in that car seat would he/she still be alive ?
